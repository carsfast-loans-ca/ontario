                consistent with the use and disclosure provisions of this Privacy Policy, unless you consent otherwise.
            </p>

            </ul>

            <p>Your Consent is Important to Us</p>

            <p>It is important to us that we collect, use or disclose your personal information where we have your
                consent to do so.&nbsp;Depending on the sensitivity of the personal information, your consent may be
                implied, deemed (using an opt-out mechanism) or express.&nbsp; Express consent can be given orally,
                electronically or in writing.&nbsp; Implied consent is consent that can reasonably be inferred from your
                action or inaction.&nbsp; For example, when you enter into an agreement with us, we will assume your
                consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information for purposes related to the
                performance of that agreement and for any other purposes identified to you at the relevant time.</p>

            <p>Typically, we will seek your consent at the time that we collect your personal information.&nbsp; In
                certain circumstances, your consent may be obtained after collection but prior to our use or disclosure
                of your personal information.&nbsp;If we plan to use or disclose your personal information for a purpose
                not previously identified (either in this Privacy Policy or separately), we will endeavor to advise you
                of that purpose before such use or disclosure.</p>

            <p>As we have described above, we may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your
                knowledge or consent where we are permitted or required to do so by applicable law or regulatory
                requirements.</p>

            <p>Choice/Opt-Out</p>

            <p>You may change or withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual obligations and
                reasonable notice, by contacting our Privacy Officer using the contact information set out below.&nbsp;
                All communications with respect to such withdrawal or variation of consent should be in writing and
                addressed to our Privacy Officer.</p>

            <p>In certain circumstances, the withdrawal of consent may render us unable to continue to provide products
                or services where the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information is necessary to provide
                the product or service.</p>

            <p>We assume that, unless you advise us otherwise, you have consented to the collection, use and disclosure
                of your personal information as explained in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>How is Your Personal Information Protected?</p>

            <p>LendingArch endeavors to maintain physical, technical and procedural safeguards that are appropriate to
                the sensitivity of the personal information in question.&nbsp; These safeguards are designed to prevent
                your personal information from loss and unauthorized access, copying, use, modification or disclosure.
            </p>

                immediately of any incident involving the loss of or unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal
                information that is in our custody or control.</p>

            <p>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</p>

            <p>LendingArch from time to time, may make changes to this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in its legal or
                regulatory obligations or in the manner in which we deal with your personal information.&nbsp; We will
                post any revised version of this Privacy Policy on our website (<a href="https://www.lendingarch.ca/">www.lendingarch.ca</a>)and we encourage you to refer back to it
                on a regular basis.</p>

            <p>Interpretation of this Privacy Policy</p>

            <p>Any interpretation associated with this Privacy Policy will be made by our Privacy Officer.&nbsp; This
                Privacy Policy includes examples but is not intended to be restricted in its application to such
                examples, therefore where the word ‘including’ is used, it shall mean ‘including without limitation’.
            </p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy does not create or confer upon any individual any rights, or impose upon LendingArch
                any obligations outside of, or in addition to, any obligations imposed by Canada’s federal and
                provincial privacy laws, as applicable. Should there be, in a specific case, any inconsistency between
                this Privacy Policy and Canada’s federal and provincial privacy laws, as applicable, this Privacy Policy
                shall be interpreted, in respect of that case, to give effect to, and comply with, such privacy laws.
